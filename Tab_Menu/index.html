            <div data-content="1" class="show">As Azwraith drove his pike through Vorn, the Dread Magus shattered into
                innumerable
                shards of light,
                saturating his killer with a strange new power. Once a humble fisherman, the Phantom Lancer Spears
                targets from afar, spawning a fragment of the Phantom Lancer himself as they Dash ahead while cutting
                foes apart in a breathtaking flurry of attacks. When cornered, he vanishes briefly from the battlefield,
                reappearing at a nearby spot while leaving behind Doppelgangers to mislead and elude pursuers. The sheer
                number of his army are often Juxtaposed with his foes, overwhelming them before their eyes can scarcely
                distinguish the Phantom Lancer from his army of clones.

            <div data-content="2">Robbed of her wings and rightful place in the Ghastly Eyrie, Shendelzare appealed to
                the
                goddess Scree'auk to grant her the dark energies that would complete her vengeance. With a Wave of
                Terror, the fallen princess heralds her arrival, unnerving foes close enough to hear her anguished cry.
                Like her airborne brethren, the Vengeful Spirit makes liberal use of Magic Missle, a simple Skywrath
                spell for stunning adversaries. Seeking martyrdom, Shendelzare instantly Displaces herself with a target
                of her choosing, gladly sacrificing herself as she swaps positions with a besieged ally, or a fleeing
                enemy. The worthy who fight alongside Shendelzare are emboldened by her Vengeance, a fanaticism that
                intensifies their blows and persists even beyond her death, as the Vengeful Spirit's presence is felt at
                all times.

            <div data-content="3">Woken from the depth of the earth, Raigor Stonehoof shapes the battlefield with
                seismic
                force. With his long ranged Fissure, the Earthshaker creates impassable terrain where none existed
                before. Never afraid to be outnumbered, the Earthshaker turns the tables with a grand Echo Slam,
                demolishing entire armies in the process. Whatever survives his disruptive Aftershocks still has a
                mighty swing to look forward to, an Enchanted Totem with the power that demolishes mountains.

            <div data-content="4">Two hundred years of selective breeding had produced Nortrom, the prophesied war-mage
                that would bring glory to the order of Aeol Drias. Therefore, disgust and disappointment followed when
                it was found that the boy could cast not even a hex. Yet, on the day of final testing, Nortrom would
                have the Last Word. His arranged opponents fell under an Arcane Curse, draining their health and
                prolonging the curse with each incantation made. Then, there was Global Silence. Not a gasp or whisper
                escaped their lips as Nortrom cut his challengers to ribbons with his multi-pronged Glaives, stealing
                their intelligence to add to his own. At that moment, it became clear to all watching — The absence of
                magic can be the greatest magic of all.

            <div data-content="5">Shadow Shaman quickly clears the way for his team's forces to march on the enemy base.
                Blasting enemies with Ether Shocks, interrupting attackers with Hexes, transforming his foe into a
                chicken, while locking down another with magical Shackles — but not before conjuring up powerful Mass
                Serpent Wards. Spitting fire in every direction, the Shadow Shaman's charmed snakes make short work of
                his disabled enemies.

            <div data-content="6">Muerta is a master of death who stalks the lands of life, corralling targets with
                fearsome Trickshots from an eternity of practice that defies the mortal mind. Her family are forever
                beyond the spirit veil, but her deal with Death allows her to briefly call on them — The Revenants — in
                times of want or need to smother her foes. Always ready to pick off unwary targets with her Spare
                Gunhand and Parting Shots, Muerta offers all of her victims Mercy, and some, are fortunate enough to
                also earn Grace — one gun to deliver the soul, and the other, to claim the soul. Muerta is at her most
                menacing when she sheds her corporeal form, Crossing the Veil of the Dead to strike her enemies with the
                ethereal fury of the damned.

            <div data-content="7">On the millennial solstice known as Wraith-Night, Ostarion stood frozen amid the
                carnage, absorbing innumerable souls as his champions sacrificed their lives for the King. Now brimming
                with Wraith Essence, Ostarion immobilizes his adversaries with Wraithfire Blast, stunning and searing
                them over time. His great-sword smashes foes in one Mortal Strike, sapping their essence to feed his
                Vampiric Spirit. Only fools trust the erratic reports of Ostarion's death. For when slain, the wraith
                energies that bind his body begin to reconstitute his parts, joining limb to torso until the Wraith
                King's Reincarnation comes full circle as his strides fearlessly towards his enemies, again.
